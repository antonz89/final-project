Digital Closet app can display Items entered manually as carousel images and an ordered list. It can also display Cards with information about items searched in the Search Target row.

Currently, I limited Cards number to 5 items. Filter in the Search Target set to  "men."  To review my app you can search target:

Shirt Black - will create 5 cards always
T-shirt White - will create 2 cards always

Sometimes it takes 5-10 seconds for API to return Data after clicking search.

I left multiple comments in the main.js file that will explain things more clearly.
