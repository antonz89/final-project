Digital Closet app can display Items entered manually as carousel images and an ordered list. It can also display Cards with information about items searched in the Search Target row.

Currently, I limited Cards number to 5 items. Filter in the Search Target set to  "men."  To review my app you can search target:

Shirt Black - will create 5 cards always
T-shirt White - will create 2 cards always

Sometimes it takes 5-10 seconds for API to return Data after clicking search.

Never remove the first item from My Inventory list if you have multiple items added, it's all has to do with "active" status in carousel. After adding items to the my inventory list, you can always remove any other item except the first one. 

I left multiple comments in the main.js file that will explain things more clearly.
